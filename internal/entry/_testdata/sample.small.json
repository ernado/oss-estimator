This is false,\n    because `directoryExists` dereferences the symbolic link.\n\n  - `getDirectoryContents` should not be called until `dir` is verified\n    to be a true directory.\n\nThere are two possible ways to handle the case where `dir` is not a true\ndirectory:\n\n  - One can delete it silently, similar to the behavior of the POSIX\n    command `rm -r`.\n\n  - Or one can raise an error, similar to the behavior of the Python\n    function `shutil.rmtree`.\n\nThe former is more elegant to implement but for backward compatibility\n`removeDirectoryRecursive` shall retain the Python-like behavior.\nAnother function `removePathRecursive` was added to implement the POSIX\nbehavior, although the decision of to export this function will be left\nfor the future.\n\nOn Windows, there are two kinds of symbolic links:\n\n  - directory symbolic links, and\n  - file symbolic links.\n\nDirectory symbolic links are treated as directories on Windows, which\nmeans `lstat` considers them directories and `DeleteFile` doesn't work.\nTo remedy this, `removePathRecursive` was tweaked to handle these\nunusual cases and avoid following symbolic links.","distinct":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Rufflewind/directory/commits/ca34a8774fd19131d594972934940267483b27ab"},{"sha":"cd7b52e73fe9d6ea65714df1a2f4394060405100","author":{"email":"22ee0097135072451429b5ac45630d52779cd49b@rufflewind.com","name":"Phil Ruffwind"},"message":"Merge pull request #16 from Rufflewind/remove-directory-recursive\n\nMake behavior of removeDirectoryRecursive more consistent","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Rufflewind/directory/commits/cd7b52e73fe9d6ea65714df1a2f4394060405100"}]},"public":true,"created_at":"2015-02-22T01:00:08Z"}

I have added the use of assigning multiple values to multiple variables in the numpy methods section. I understand that this is introducing two new concepts at the same time (methods and multiple assignment). \r\n\r\nIt does allow the student to chunk the three descriptive statistics though so is might lower the load on working memory\r\nThe other options are to introduce simultaneous assignment in it's own section, either in this lesson or move it elsewhere and move the challenge. There is also the option of removing the multiple assignment from the challenge and assigning each variable separately.","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alistairwalsh/python-novice-inflammation/commits/6cd5eebdd50010dfeabf9808727395c926ed687d"}]},"public":true,"created_at":"2015-09-15T01:00:11Z"}

Add documentation for the `WebServer` class\r\n\r\nAny guidance and/or points in the right direction would be much appreciated!","created_at":"2016-08-26T04:26:43Z","updated_at":"2016-09-14T17:00:09Z","closed_at":"2016-09-14T17:00:09Z","merged_at":"2016-09-14T17:00:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"aa96e74e4ae537f1f473905cb2c925516e7841a2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onefinestay/nameko/pulls/352/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onefinestay/nameko/pulls/352/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onefinestay/nameko/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onefinestay/nameko/issues/352/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onefinestay/nameko/statuses/944869ce683e837a67b2c9457d84249fbea79a3c","head":{"label":"jessepollak:add-wsgi-flexibility-to-server","ref":"add-wsgi-flexibility-to-server","sha":"944869ce683e837a67b2c9457d84249fbea79a3c","user":{"login":"jessepollak","id":1097953,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097953?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessepollak","html_url":"https://github.com/jessepollak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessepollak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessepollak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessepollak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessepollak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessepollak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessepollak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessepollak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessepollak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessepollak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":66616324,"name":"nameko","full_name":"jessepollak/nameko","owner":{"login":"jessepollak","id":1097953,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097953?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessepollak","html_url":"https://github.com/jessepollak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessepollak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessepollak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessepollak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessepollak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessepollak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessepollak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessepollak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessepollak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessepollak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/jessepollak/nameko","description":"Python

API endpoints coming.\r\n\r\nDrip Users need to have Tags applied.  The tags will be decided by an Admin user.  The admin user needs a UI like this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1054674/37640342-57016ff0-2bd2-11e8-84cd-2d6447d7e467.png)\r\n\r\nAs they type, it should auto-suggest from the previously created tags.  After they add the tag, it should transform from text to the tag element.  It can have an \"X\" to delete, but once complete, it is immutable.\r\n\r\nQUESTION: How do you prefer the API be set up?  I see two options:\r\n\r\n1) Send the `drip_user_id` and `tags_list`.  The API first removes all previous tags, and then writes all the new tags.  In this way, you are always sending the complete master list.\r\n\r\n2) You send individual changes (add one, delete one).\r\n\r\nWhich do you prefer?"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/data-skeptic/dataskeptic.com/issues/comments/376065459","html_url":"https://github.com/data-skeptic/dataskeptic.com/issues/606#issuecomment-376065459","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/data-skeptic/dataskeptic.com/issues/606","id":376065459,"user":{"login":"kylepolich","id":1054674,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1054674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylepolich","html_url":"https://github.com/kylepolich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylepolich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylepolich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylepolich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylepolich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylepolich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylepolich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylepolich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylepolich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylepolich/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-26T07:00:25Z","updated_at":"2018-03-26T07:00:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"GET `drip/tag/list`\n\nPOST `drip/tag/add`\n`{name, description}`\n\nGET `drip/user/tag/list'?email=kyle@dataskeptic.com`\n\nPOST `drip/user/tag/add`\n`{tag_id, email}`"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-03-26T07:00:25Z","org":{"id":17736366,"login":"data-skeptic","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/data-skeptic","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17736366?"}}

The one thing that has alluded me was Smart serial as I was testing it with an 8i20 that I had yanked from an existing machine running LinuxCNC. My config would discover the 8i20 and all of it's properties, then immediately throw communication faults and disconnect. So I was working with SS firmware  which was probably unverified in mksocfpga, a SS hardware implementation that could not be verified due to the above and only an 8i20 that I know for a fact works fine.\r\n\r\nI picked up a 7i66-8 today to mess with. I plugged it into my board and it discovers, can read and write to I/O and shows 0 SS fault-counts. So it works perfectly fine. I have to draw the conclusion that the 8i20 driver is broken in mk-hal.

I have checked all solutions published and all have the same memory leak issue.\r\n\r\nThe structs of this solution are:\r\n```\r\ntypedef struct {                                                                \r\n   size_t row, column;                                                          \r\n} saddle_point_t;                                                               \r\n                                                                                \r\ntypedef struct {                                                                \r\n   size_t count;                                                                \r\n   saddle_point_t points[];                                                     \r\n} saddle_points_t; \r\n```\r\n\r\nIn file [test_saddle_points.c](https://github.com/exercism/c/blob/master/exercises/saddle-points/test/test_saddle_points.c), `free()` is called just for the main struct `saddle_points_t`, but not for the field `points`.\r\n\r\nThe [example.c](https://github.com/exercism/c/blob/master/exercises/saddle-points/src/example.c) uses `realloc()` and calculates the size of the main struct + points field, so the `free()` works fine and there is no memory leak.\r\n```\r\nrealloc(saddle_points,                                                                                                                                                    \r\n            sizeof(saddle_points_t) +       \r\n            sizeof(saddle_point_t) *        \r\n            ++count);\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, I think this approach is not very common, and we can see that all students have submit solutions using `calloc()` for the main struct and another `calloc()` for points field. It's part of mentoring program to check if the solution handles memory allocation correctly and we provide a valgrind option on `make`.\r\n\r\nI was expecting the test to free fields point too:\r\n```\r\nfree(actual->points)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother minor issue is that students should implement function `saddlePoints`, but the naming convention we have been using for C track is snake_case, so it should be `saddle_points`."},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/exercism/c/issues/comments/539178980","html_url":"https://github.com/exercism/c/issues/413#issuecomment-539178980","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/exercism/c/issues/413","id":539178980,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzOTE3ODk4MA==","user":{"login":"wolf99","id":281700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTcwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/281700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolf99","html_url":"https://github.com/wolf99","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolf99/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolf99/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolf99/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolf99/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolf99/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolf99/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolf99/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolf99/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolf99/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-07T20:00:00Z","updated_at":"2019-10-07T20:00:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Good call @ryanplusplus"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2019-10-07T20:00:00Z","org":{"id":5624255,"login":"exercism","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/exercism","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5624255?"}}

Early testing caught this segfault on non-Windows platforms (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2059\">#2059</a> and <a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/commit/956534e02ef280795a187c16f6ac04e107f23c5d\">libxml@956534e</a>) but it was incompletely fixed and is still an issue on Windows platforms that are using system DLLs.</p>\n<p>We work around this by configuring libxml2 in this situation to use its default memory management functions.

Early testing caught this segfault on non-Windows platforms (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2059\">#2059</a> and <a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/commit/956534e02ef280795a187c16f6ac04e107f23c5d\">libxml@956534e</a>) but it was incompletely fixed and is still an issue on Windows platforms that are using system DLLs.</p>\n<p>We work around this by configuring libxml2 in this situation to use its default memory management functions. Note that if Nokogiri is not on Windows, or is not using shared system libraries, it will will continue to configure libxml2 to use Ruby's memory management functions. <code>Nokogiri::VERSION_INFO[&quot;libxml&quot;][&quot;memory_management&quot;]</code> will allow you to verify when the default memory management functions are being used.

is my current state of the openQA tests for the kiwi staging area.\r\nThis fixes #2, #5, #6\r\n\r\nWhat it does:\r\n- iso images are booted, login is tested and either the vm is turned off, if this is an installation iso or rebooted and reloged in, if it is a live iso\r\n- disk images are booted, user is logged in, rebooted, user logs in again and then the VM is turned off\r\n- the created hard drive of an installation iso is saved and goes through the same test as any other kiwi disk image\r\n\r\nwhat currently does not work:\r\n- ~~login on the openstack qcow2 image is broken, the default credentials do not work~~ (fixed by @schaefi, the image had its root console deactivated)\r\n- all the raw disk images appear not to work, for some reason openQA cannot create a working disk image from these\r\n- kiwi-test-image-disk-legacy.x86_64.iso and kiwi-test-image-custom-partitions.x86_64.iso hang during the installation and never reach a login prompt\r\n- the hackery that I added to select the correct entry in the boot menu is not really that great and does only appear to work by accident\r\n\r\nWhat still needs to be done:\r\n- [x] documentation what is going on and how to configure openqa (external settings are necessary)\r\n- ~~[ ] add some actually meaningful testing, currently we just test whether this image boots~~\r\n- [x] test other distributions as well\r\n- [x] reconsider whether we should include the build id of the images in the schedule command: calling them by their static link means that openQA does not download newer versions if the old asset stays around (this should be done)","performed_via_github_app":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OSInside/kiwi-functional-tests/issues/comments/867706206","html_url":"https://github.com/OSInside/kiwi-functional-tests/pull/3#issuecomment-867706206","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OSInside/kiwi-functional-tests/issues/3","id":867706206,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2NzcwNjIwNg==","user":{"login":"dcermak","id":45594031,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NTk0MDMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45594031?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcermak","html_url":"https://github.com/dcermak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcermak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcermak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcermak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcermak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcermak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcermak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcermak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcermak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcermak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-24T15:00:03Z","updated_at":"2021-06-24T15:00:03Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@schaefi

From repository\r\n    2. (_new_) From Project DB\r\n    3. From definitely-gp\r\n    4. Derived (Go) or default\r\n- When starting from a custom `.gitpod.yml` (from the Project DB), the initializer also places the uncomitted `.gitpod.yml` into the workspace (to encourage repo-based configs)\r\n\r\nHow to test:\r\n\r\n- Create a new team\r\n- Add a new project (either by inserting into `d_b_project`, or we set up a GitHub App integration -- @AlexTugarev could you help with the latter?)\r\n- If the project already has a repo-based config, the configurator should indicate that and be disabled. If there is no repo config, the configurator should allow you to write a new `.gitpod.yml` (e.g. based on one of the presets) and then test it / iterate on it in a quick loop (with the build output on the right)\r\n\r\nThe UX of this is still rough, but the goal is to add this final step rather soon, and then iterate on the entire Add Project flow.","created_at":"2021-06-28T09:18:16Z","updated_at":"2021-07-21T08:00:01Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"15cbca865d27363a6344dd9cdb57e4155d6384e6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":3171280082,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTcxMjgwMDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gitpod-io/gitpod/labels/approved","name":"approved","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":2481698797,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDgxNjk4Nzk3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gitpod-io/gitpod/labels/component:%20dashboard","name":"component: dashboard","color":"e1e4e8","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3173195428,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTczMTk1NDI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gitpod-io/gitpod/labels/do-not-merge/hold","name":"do-not-merge/hold","color":"B60205","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3046862260,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMDQ2ODYyMjYw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gitpod-io/gitpod/labels/roadmap%20item:%20teams%20&%20projects","name":"roadmap item: teams & projects","color":"656769","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3171736349,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTcxNzM2MzQ5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gitpod-io/gitpod/labels/size/XXL","name":"size/XXL","color":"BFD4F2","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gitpod-io/gitpod/pulls/4631/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gitpod-io/gitpod/pulls/4631/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gitpod-io/gitpod/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/4631/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gitpod-io/gitpod/statuses/8601021844904dcd946b303258e7d1f71cf4a7b6","head":{"label":"gitpod-io:jx/configure-project","ref":"jx/configure-project","sha":"8601021844904dcd946b303258e7d1f71cf4a7b6","user":{"login":"gitpod-io","id":37021919,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM3MDIxOTE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37021919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io","html_url":"https://github.com/gitpod-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":130879558,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzA4Nzk1NTg=","name":"gitpod","full_name":"gitpod-io/gitpod","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gitpod-io","id":37021919,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM3MDIxOTE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37021919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io","html_url":"https://github.com/gitpod-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod","description":"Gitpod automates the provisioning of ready-to-code development environments.
